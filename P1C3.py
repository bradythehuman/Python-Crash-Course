# Methods include append, insert, pop. A del statement can be used to remove an\
# entry from the list if the index is known. The pop method can do this as well by\
# by giving it the index as an argument. The remove method will also remove any\
# value but it is done by giving the function the argument which you would like\
# to see removed. .remove will also only remove the first instance of the value.\
# The sort method can be used to put the list in alphabetical order and reverse\
# can flip the list around.
